# BigSense Application
You only need to build this app and do not need to modify alot. You only have to change the value of the parameter SSH_HOST in the Java-class UpdateService.java. Here you can also change the following values:
- INTERVAL: Specifies the interval in which the phone contacts the server
- SSH_PORT: Port of the listening SSH-Port on the phone
- SSH_RESTART_INTERVAL_IN_MILLISECONDS: The interval in which the ssh-server will be restarted
